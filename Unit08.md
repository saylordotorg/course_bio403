**Unit 8: Forensic Biotechnology and Biometrics** <span id="8"></span> 
*One of the practical applications of genomics and DNA technology has
been its impact in security and the legal system.  Because every human
being has a unique genome, scientists have used DNA visualization
technology to identify individuals according to a particular genetic
makeup.  Because the odds of someone else having the same sequence are
extremely low, it is used as an error-proof test of identification or
verification.  The most common application has been paternity testing in
cases of doubt as to who is the parent.  The addition of DNA evidence
into the legal system has also implicated and freed many people of
crimes based on what was collected at the crime scene.  DNA
fingerprinting is the most reliable biometrics technique that is used to
identify an individual.  This unit briefly describes two non-DNA
biometrics techniques as well, namely friction ridge pattern analysis
and iris recognition.  The fingerprint reader and the iris scanner
investigate developmental patterns, thus these techniques can
distinguish identical twins.*

     Instructions: Please study the “Mitochondrial DNA Analysis” section
    on this page.  Please note that mitochondrial DNA is maternally
    inherited; a mother and her children all have identical
    mitochondrial DNA.  Thus, mitochondrial DNA is not individual.  On
    the other hand, it is present in many copies in a cell, which offers
    higher sensitivity.  Higher sensitivity is crucial, when samples are
    decayed. Forensic mitochondrial DNA analysis is more elaborate,
    because it involves sequencing and sequence analysis of the
    samples.

    assessment on this page. This is a multiple choice assessment with
    one correct answer. Clicking on an answer will bring you to another

    short explanation. Please read the explanation carefully. If you
    click on a wrong answer, then the click will bring you to a tutorial
    page. Please study the tutorial page carefully. You will be prompted
    to return to the assessment and complete it again. Please note that
    this assessment is a brief introduction to classical friction ridge
    pattern analysis. The modern high throughput fingerprint analysis is
    computerized; for example the FBI is using the Integrated Automated
    Fingerprint Identification system (IAFIS). IAFIS relies on minutia
    recognition rather than the identification of the basic
    loop-arch-whorl (LAW) friction ridge patterns. The results of the
    computerized fingerprint database analysis are further analyzed by
    several criminalist. This last manual step is once again relies on
    complex friction ridge pattern recognition, including LAW. Original
    prints are the courtesy of Frederick Ford.
