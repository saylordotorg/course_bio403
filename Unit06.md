**Unit 6: Genetic Engineering of Animals** <span id="6"></span> 
*Just as biotechnology has given rise to genetically engineered plants,
it has also applied many of the same techniques and knowledge to
animals.  This unit provides an overview of the current state of animal
genetic engineering.  So far we have produced genetically modified mice,
fish, flies, hydra, and pigs, just to name a few.  As you can imagine,
the applications of modifying animals to suit our needs can have immense
consequences and have raised significant concern.  This unit also
examines some of the issues surrounding the production of “customized”
animals, including the ethics of genetically altering humans.*
