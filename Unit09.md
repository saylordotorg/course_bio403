**Unit 9: Environmental Biotechnology and Renewable Energy** <span
id="9"></span> 
*This unit focuses on the biotechnology to help clean our environment,
with the help of microorganisms.  For a century, microbes have been used
to clean our sewage; recently, scientists have begun to create new ways
for microbes to aid our environmental cleanup efforts.  This unit
focuses on how microbes are grown and cultured for environmental
purposes.  We discuss the current state of bioremediation or the use of
organisms to clean contaminants from the environment.  We will end with
an overview of the current ways we use biotechnology to create renewable
sources of energy, such as biodiesel and biogas.*
