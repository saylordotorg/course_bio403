**Unit 1: Introduction to Biotechnology** <span id="1"></span> 
*In this unit, you will analyze DNA structure, practice Mendelian
genetics problems, and familiarize yourself with gene expression studies
and with biological systems in biotechnology.*

**Unit 1 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take you approximately 2.5 hours to complete.  
  
 ☐    Subunit 1.1: 0.5 hour  
  
 ☐    Subunit 1.2: 1.0 hour  
  
 ☐    Subunit 1.3: 1.0hour

**Unit1 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:  
  
-   Analyze the structure of a DNA double helix based on an X-ray
    diffraction pattern.
-   Calculate the genotype and phenotype of offspring using a Punnett
    square.
-   Describe the scope of biotechnology.

    51](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/tech/DNA-photograph.html)” (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: Please investigate the critical evidence that led to
    the model of the DNA double helix.  Rosalind Franklin’s X-ray
    diffraction image \#51 is shown here.  Click on the “Launch
    interactive” button and advance step by step from image \#51 to the
    double helix model of DNA.  Please note that all structural
    parameters of the double helix are provided by image \#51.

    step-by-step tutorial on using Punnett squares to determine how
    alleles of one gene segregate.

     Instructions: Please watch the video (26 minutes) for a
    step-by-step tutorial on using Punnett squares to determine how
    alleles of more than one gene assort independently.  During sexual
    reproduction, both parents pass on some of their traits to their
    offspring(s).  Mendel's law of segregation describes how different
    versions of one trait are combined in the offspring.  Mendel's law
    of independent assortment describes how different versions of
    different traits are combined in the offspring.  Please make sure
    that you can predict the genotype and phenotype of the F1 generation
    using Punnett squares.  You may need to follow this video several
    times.  Be patient; it may take some time to get used to the Punnett
    squares.  This is a great tool, used every day in genetic
    counseling.

    Assessments](http://www.saylor.org/content/bio403/assessments/BIO403_Unit_1_assessment_main.html)"
    (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: You will find links to the following three
    assessments on this page: “Mendelian Inheritance of Traits,”
    “Codominance – an Extension of the Mendelian Inheritance of Traits,”
    and “Independent Assortment – Dihybrid Cross.” These are multiple
    choice assessments with one correct answer. Clicking on an answer
    will bring you to another page. If your answer is correct, then it
    is acknowledged with a short explanation. Please read the
    explanation carefully and proceed to the next assessment as prompted
    at the bottom of the page. If you clicked on the wrong answer, then
    the click will bring you to a tutorial page. Please study the
    tutorial page carefully. At the end of the tutorial page, you will
    be prompted to return to the assessment and complete it again. You
    can also move between multiple choice pages using the links at the
    top of the page. Please complete the three assessments in order,
    because the assessments are listed in increasing complexity.
