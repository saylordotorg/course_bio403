Biotechnology is the application of biology and biological concepts to
science and engineering.  It is the crossroad of the biological sciences
with other major disciplines of science, from organic chemistry to
mechanical engineering.  The earliest applications of biotechnology
involve people of ancient civilizations using organisms to create bread
and wine.  The discovery of the Penicillium mold to combat infection is
another famous example, as its production involved a specially designed
fermentation process using microorganisms.  Nowadays, scientists use
almost all aspects of biology in their applications, from DNA to protein
to cellular organelles.  Living organisms, especially microorganisms,
are thought of as biochemical machinery, able to be edited and changed
to create new purposes.  We could program them to create insulin for
diabetes patients or to produce fuel for our cars.  Biotechnology is
nearly limitless in its applications. As biotechnology is a very diverse
topic, this course will introduce you to the major concepts shared by
different fields and also explain some of the current major areas of
biotechnology.  We will discuss genetic engineering of plants and
animals, as well as the current major medical, environmental, and
agricultural applications of each.  There are also a variety of topics
that we will cover after this, from nanobiotechnology to environmental
biotechnology.  As each field has its own science and terminology beyond
biology, there are many new concepts and terms to be learned, which can
cause some difficulty for students, so be patient and don’t become
overwhelmed.

### Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this course, the student will be able
to:  
  

-   Identify and describe the fields of biotechnology.
-   Compare and contrast forward and reverse genetics and the way they
    influence biodiversity.
-   Compare and contrast systemic studies of the genome, transcriptome,
    and proteome.
-   Explain how genome projects are performed, and discuss the
    completion and the information processing in these projects.
-   Describe and explain the principles of existing gene therapies.
-   Design strategies that support genetic counseling.
-   Explain and analyze DNA fingerprints, and compare DNA fingerprints
    to non-DNA biometrics.
-   Describe and compare bioremediation technologies in air, water, and
    soil.
-   Design strategies for generating genetically modified organisms, and
    discuss ethical concerns.
-   Discuss emerging fields in biotechnology.

√    Have read the [Saylor Student
Handbook.](http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Saylor-StudentHandbook.pdf)

√    Have completed the following courses: [BIO101: Introduction to
Cellular and Molecular Biology](http://www.saylor.org/courses/bio101a/),
[BIO301: Cell Biology](http://www.saylor.org/courses/bio301/) or
[BIO307: Microbiology](http://www.saylor.org/courses/bio307/), [BIO305:
Genetics](http://www.saylor.org/courses/bio101/), and [BIO311: Molecular
Biology](http://www.saylor.org/courses/bio311/). Prior completion of
[BIO401: Biochemistry](http://www.saylor.org/courses/bio401/) is
strongly recommended. 

### Course Information

Welcome to BIO403.  Below, please find general information on this
course and its requirements.

**Course Designer: ** Marianna Pintér, Ph.D,

**Primary Resources: ** This course is composed of a range of different
free, online materials.  However, the course makes primary use of the
following materials:

- Nature Education’s [Scitable](http://www.nature.com/scitable)  
 - National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)’s
[Bookshelf](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books)  
 - John W. Kimball’s [Biology
Pages](http://users.rcn.com/jkimball.ma.ultranet/BiologyPages/)  
 - Davidson College's [Biology @
Davidson](http://www.bio.davidson.edu/)  
 - Oak Ridge National Laboratory's [Human Genome Project Information
(HGPI)](http://www.ornl.gov/sci/techresources/.index.shtml/)  
 - Khan Academy's [Biology Videos](http://www.khanacademy.org/#biology)

**Requirements for Completion:**  In order to complete this course, you
will need to work through each unit and all of its assigned materials. 
Please pay special attention to Units 3 and 4, as these lay the
groundwork for understanding the more advanced, exploratory material
presented in the latter units.  You will also need to complete:

      - Subunit 1.2 Assessment  
       - Subunit 2.2 Assessment  
       - Subunit 2.3 Assessment  
       - Subunit 3.1 Assessment  
       - Sub-subunit 4.3.2 Assessment  
       - Subunit 5.4 Assessment  
       - Sub-subunit 6.5.1 Assessment  
       - Subunit 7.2 Assessment  
       - Subunit 8.3 Assessment  
       - Sub-subunit 9.8.3 Assessment  
       - Subunit 10.5 Assessment  
       - The Final Exam  
  

Please note that you will only receive an official grade on your Final
Exam.  However, in order to adequately prepare for this exam, you will
need to work through the problem sets within the above-listed
assessments.  
    
 In order to pass this course, you will need to earn a 70% or higher on
the Final Exam.  Your score on the exam will be tabulated as soon as you
complete it.  If you do not pass the exam, you may take it again.  
    
 **Time Commitment: ** This course should take you a total of **136
hours** to complete.  Each unit includes a “time advisory” that lists
the amount of time you are expected to spend on each subunit.  These
should help you plan your time accordingly.  It may be useful to take a
look at these time advisories and determine how much time you have over
the next few weeks to complete each unit and then set goals for
yourself.  For example, Unit 1 should take you about 2.5 hours to
complete.  Perhaps you can sit down with your calendar and decide to
complete all of Unit 1 on Monday night.  Then, you should consider
moving on to Unit 2, which should take you approximately 9 hours to
complete.  For example, you may decide to complete subunits 2.1 and 2.2
(a total of 3 hours) on Tuesday night, subunit 2.3 (a total of 1 hour)
on Wednesday night, etc.  
  
 **Tips/Suggestions:**  As noted in the “Course Requirements,” there are
prerequisites for this course.  You certainly want to review [BIO101
Introduction to Molecular and Cellular
Biology](http://www.saylor.org/courses/bio101/) (especially Unit 3), the
entire [BIO311: Molecular
Biology](http://www.saylor.org/courses/bio311/) course, and [BIO301 Cell
Biology](http://www.saylor.org/courses/bio301/) course (especially Units
6 and 8) before you begin.  If you find Unit 4 fascinating in this
course, then consider taking
the [BIO401:Biochemistry](http://www.saylor.org/courses/bio401/) course
as well if you have not yet done so.  These notes will be useful to
review as you study for your Final Exam.
