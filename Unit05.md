**Unit 5: Genetic Engineering of Plants** <span id="5"></span> 
*Plants have long been engineered for human use ever since the earliest
civilizations established agricultural-based societies.  Most of the
cultivated crops that we eat as food have already been artificially
selected for thousands of years for certain characteristics.  With
modern biotechnology, we have turned this largely trial-and-error
process into a major science as we understand the functions of more and
more genes and develop more sophisticated methods for introducing exotic
genes into plants.  The new feature of the modern technology is the
ability to produce transgenic plants.  For example, the addition of
certain vitamins into rice plants has the potential to solve endemic
malnutrition for millions of people in third-world countries.  This unit
will also examine the safety and health issues surrounding genetically
engineered plants.*
