**Unit 7: Genetic Defects and Gene Therapy** <span id="7"></span> 
*One of the great potentials of biotechnology is the ability to create
cures for human genetic defects.  Because such a disease is directly
caused by a dysfunctional or missing gene, in theory, by injecting
patients with a product that replaces or adds the target gene, they will
be cured forever.  Gene therapy efforts attack retroviral infections as
well, for example, by modifying the host cell’s virus recognition site.

    or sex-linked inheritance. Clicking on an answer will bring you to
    another page. If your answer is correct, then it is acknowledged
    with a short explanation. Please read the explanation carefully. If
    you clicked on the wrong answer, then the click will bring you to a
