**Unit 10: Emerging Biotechnology Fields** <span id="10"></span> 
*Our last unit looks at some emerging areas of biotechnology. 
Immune-based biotechnology, for example, utilizes our highly
sophisticated and potent immune system to do certain tasks like
destroying tumor cells.  Another example, nanobiotechnology, looks at
cellular processes not as microscopic things but as large-scale
assemblers and builders.  Pathway engineering tries to create entire new
sets of reaction pathways so that we might one day be able to convert
toxic waste into something useful, such as table sugar! *
